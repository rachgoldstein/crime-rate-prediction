This program implements linear regression and ridge regression (without the use of machine learning libraries) to analyze local crime statistics for 1,994 US communities.
The response y is the crime rate.
The data is analyzed using the closed form solution and gradient desent for both regression models. K-fold cross validation is used to find an optimum hyperparameter for ridge regression.
